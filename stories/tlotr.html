        <h1>The Lord of the Rings</h1>
        <h4>By J.R.R. Tolkien</h4>
    
        <h5>Prologue: The Shadow Stirs</h5>
        <p>
            In the west of Middle-earth lies the Shire, a land of peace and rolling hills. But far beyond its borders, in the dark lands of Mordor, something ancient began to stir — a power not seen for an age.
    
            Long ago, the Dark Lord Sauron forged a Ring — one Ring to rule them all. Lost for centuries, it has been found.
    
            And with it, the world begins to shift once more.
        </p>
    
        <h5>Chapter 1: The Inheritance</h5>
        <p>
            Frodo Baggins of Bag End was no hero. But when his uncle Bilbo vanished after a mysterious birthday party — leaving behind only riddles, stories, and a golden ring — the burden fell to him.
    
            “Keep it secret. Keep it safe,” whispered Gandalf the Grey, eyes troubled.
    
            For the Ring was not just gold. It was alive with a whispering will, ancient and corrupting. And Sauron wanted it back.
        </p>
    
        <h5>Chapter 2: The Nine Ride</h5>
        <p>
            Black Riders moved through the night — faceless, voiceless, bound to the Ring's call. Wherever Frodo fled, they followed, drawn by its whisper.
    
            With Samwise Gamgee at his side, and two more hobbits swept up in the flight, Frodo fled the Shire. They crossed forests, hills, and shadows deeper than night.
    
            In Bree, they met a stranger called Strider — a man cloaked in mystery and silence. But his eyes knew the wild, and his blade had seen darkness.
    
            “If you want to survive,” he said, “you must trust me.”
        </p>
    
        <h5>Chapter 3: The Fellowship</h5>
        <p>
            In the elven refuge of Rivendell, the truth was laid bare. The Ring could not be hidden. It could not be wielded. It must be destroyed — in the fires of Mount Doom, where it was made.
    
            And so the Fellowship was formed: Frodo, bearer of the Ring. Sam, loyal and brave. Merry and Pippin, quick-witted and bold. Gandalf, wise and weary. Aragorn, heir of kings. Legolas the elf, Gimli the dwarf, and Boromir of Gondor.
    
            Nine companions to face nine Riders. But the path ahead was darkened with betrayal, loss, and the weight of the world.
        </p>
    
        <h5>Chapter 4: The Breaking</h5>
        <p>
            The Fellowship never reached Mordor as one.
    
            In the mines of Moria, Gandalf fell to shadow. “Fly, you fools!” were his last words, echoing down a chasm older than memory.
    
            Grief turned to resolve. But darkness grew bolder. Boromir, tempted by the Ring, fell to its lure — and to the blades of orcs.
    
            Frodo chose solitude. He could not risk his friends. But Sam followed.
    
            “I made a promise, Mr. Frodo,” he said, stepping into the water. “Don’t you leave him, Samwise Gamgee. And I don’t mean to.”
        </p>
    
        <h5>Chapter 5: Into Mordor</h5>
        <p>
            Through marshes haunted by dead faces, past black gates and forgotten paths, Frodo and Sam were led by Gollum — a creature broken by the Ring, twisted by its hunger.
    
            “It hurts us, precious,” he hissed.
    
            But Mordor was not empty. Sauron’s eye swept the lands. Every step burned with dread.
    
            As Frodo weakened, Sam grew stronger. And when Frodo fell beneath the weight of the Ring, it was Sam who carried him.
    
            “I can’t carry it for you,” he said, “but I can carry you.”
        </p>
    
        <h5>Chapter 6: The Final Ascent</h5>
        <p>
            Atop Mount Doom, the Ring called louder than ever.
    
            Frodo stood at the edge — and claimed it.
    
            But Gollum lunged, fighting not for justice but desire. In their struggle, both fell — Gollum with the Ring, laughing as he vanished into the fire.
    
            The Ring was unmade.
    
            And far away, the Dark Tower crumbled. Sauron screamed once — then was silent forever.
        </p>
    
        <h5>Epilogue: The Grey Havens</h5>
        <p>
            Peace returned, but not unchanged.
    
            The hobbits came home — heroes, yet strangers. The Shire had been scarred. And Frodo, wounded in soul and spirit, could not heal in a land so small.
    
            In time, he sailed west, across the sea, where pain would fade.
    
            “It’s time, Sam,” he whispered. “The journey doesn’t end here.”
    
            And thus, the Ring-bearer passed into legend, and the age of elves and magic waned.
    
            But in the hearts of those who remember — the Fellowship endures.
