        <h1>Sherlock Holmes</h1>
        <h4>By Sir Arthur Conan Doyle</h4>
        <h5>Chapter 1: A Peculiar Invitation</h5>
        <p>It was in the spring of 1895 when a curious case first reached us at 221B Baker Street. I, Dr. John Watson, was engaged in reading the morning newspaper when Holmes, who had been lounging by the window, sprang suddenly to his feet.

            "A visitor approaches, Watson," he said, peering out. "Observe — a gentleman in a fine but dusty coat, hat askew, and gloves worn thin. A traveler, no doubt, and in haste."
            
            Moments later, a frantic knock at the door confirmed Holmes’s assessment. Mrs. Hudson ushered the man into our sitting room.
            
            "I am Mr. Edgar Pembroke," he said, wringing his hat in his hands. "I must beg your assistance, Mr. Holmes. It concerns my family's estate — Bellmere Hall — and a terrible fear that has gripped us."
            
            Holmes gestured for him to sit. "Begin at the beginning, Mr. Pembroke."
            
            Pembroke hesitated, gathering himself. "Two nights ago, the great bell of Bellmere, which hangs in the tower above the hall, rang thrice at midnight. Yet — the bell rope had been cut months ago for repairs. No living soul could have rung it."
            
            Holmes raised an eyebrow. "A supernatural affair, you suggest?"
            
            Pembroke shook his head violently. "No, sir! I seek rational explanation. Yet what followed chills me to the bone. On the morning after the bell tolled, our groundskeeper, old Harris, was found dead at the foot of the tower — his neck broken."
            
            I exchanged a glance with Holmes. Pembroke continued, "And last night — the bell tolled again."
            
            Holmes’s fingers steepled under his chin. "And this morning?"
            
            Pembroke’s voice dropped. "My younger sister, Lucy, was found unconscious in the garden. She remains insensible."
            
            Holmes rose at once. "We leave for Bellmere within the hour."
        </p>
        <h5>Chapter 2: Bellmere Hall</h5>
        <p>Bellemere Hall stood atop a lonely hill in Sussex, a grand if decaying structure, its turrets and battlements black against the setting sun as our carriage approached. A heavy mist curled along the ground, and the mournful caws of crows echoed across the moor.

            Pembroke met us at the great doors. "This way," he urged, leading us into a cavernous hall lit by sputtering gas lamps. The air was thick with age and dampness.
            
            He introduced us to the remaining members of the household: Lady Pembroke, an austere woman with sharp eyes; Mr. Miles Cartwright, a distant cousin and frequent guest; and Miss Emily Farrow, Lucy’s devoted companion.
            
            Holmes inspected the tower first. We climbed a narrow, spiraling staircase to the belfry. The bell itself was a monstrous iron thing, silent and immobile. Holmes examined the mechanism.
            
            "The bell rope was severed, you say?" Holmes asked.
            
            "Yes," Pembroke replied. "Only the tower stairs remain."
            
            Holmes traced a hand along the ancient wooden floorboards. "And yet someone could ascend... if they dared."
            
            Outside, we found Lucy’s prone form in the drawing room, tended by Miss Farrow. Holmes approached carefully. "May I?"
            
            Miss Farrow nodded tearfully. Holmes bent low, examining Lucy’s pallid face, her wrists, her breathing.
            
            "She was not struck nor poisoned," Holmes murmured. "Rather... shocked, perhaps. Terror has laid her low."
            
            He straightened. "Tell me, has anyone else fallen ill?"
            
            "No," Pembroke said. "But many of the servants have fled."
            
            Holmes’s eyes glittered. "All the better. Fewer suspects remain."    
        </p>
        <h5>Chapter 3: Whispers in the Night</h5>
            <p>Holmes insisted we remain awake that night. A roaring fire kept the chill at bay as we sat vigil in the great hall. Midnight approached.

                Suddenly, a sound — faint, almost imperceptible — stirred the air: a soft creaking, like footsteps along ancient wood. Holmes motioned me to silence.
                
                Then — the bell tolled. Once. Twice. Thrice.
                
                The sound reverberated through the stone like the voice of doom.
                
                Holmes sprang to his feet and dashed for the tower, lantern in hand. I followed, my heart pounding. We reached the base of the stairwell — and Holmes stopped me with a hand.
                
                "Listen," he whispered.
                
                Footsteps above.
                
                Holmes moved like a panther, taking the stairs three at a time. I lumbered after him.
                
                Near the top, we caught a shadow — a figure cloaked in black — just slipping out onto the battlements. Holmes gave chase, but the figure vaulted the parapet and disappeared into the mist below.
                
                Holmes swore under his breath. He examined the stone. "Rope marks. Someone scaled down."
                
                I stared at him. "But who?"
                
                Holmes only smiled thinly. "We shall soon know."
            </p>
        <h5>Chapter 4: The Puzzle Pieces</h5>
        <p>
            The next day, Holmes set to work methodically.

            First, he examined the cut bell rope. "Done with a sharp blade," he muttered, "but not recently. No, our midnight visitor ascends without aid."

            He then inspected Lucy’s garden.

            Near the rose bushes, he found footprints — leading to a narrow path beyond the wall.

            "Someone spirited Miss Lucy from her bed, brought her here — and terrified her into unconsciousness."

            Back in the house, Holmes interrogated each member carefully.

            Lady Pembroke denied any knowledge. Cartwright was nervous but firm. Miss Farrow wept constantly and clung to Lucy’s bedside.

            Holmes lingered on Cartwright. "You are a distant cousin?"

            "Yes," Cartwright said stiffly. "Visiting for several months."

            "And you have no interest in Bellmere’s inheritance?"

            Cartwright’s jaw tightened. "None."

            Yet Holmes’s gaze lingered on him thoughtfully.
        </p>
        <h5>Chapter 5: The Trap is Set</h5>
        <p>That evening, Holmes laid a careful plan.

            He arranged for the remaining servants to seal the tower stairway, leaving only one hidden passage known to Holmes — a disused servant’s door at the rear.
            
            Then, he and I concealed ourselves near the tower base, hidden in the heavy mist.
            
            Hours passed. At last, a shadow moved — someone slipping toward the tower, clutching something bulky.
            
            Holmes and I sprang forward.
            
            "Hold, in the Queen’s name!" Holmes barked.
            
            The figure froze — then bolted.
            
            We gave chase. Across the misty moor we ran, stumbling over roots and stones. Holmes moved with astonishing speed, and at last tackled the figure to the ground.
            
            It was Cartwright.
            
            Under his coat — a heavy set of tools: a grappling hook, rope, and a small hammer.
            
            Holmes pulled him upright. "Confess, man! What was your aim?"
            
            Cartwright sagged. "I only sought to frighten them," he muttered. "So that Lady Pembroke would sell Bellmere... cheap. I have debts, terrible debts."
            
            "And Lucy Pembroke?" Holmes said coldly.
            
            Cartwright hesitated. "I meant her no harm. I only... she awoke when I crept through the garden. She screamed, fainted. I panicked."
            
            Holmes shook his head grimly. "You shall explain yourself to the magistrate."</p>
        <h5>Chapter 6: Epilogue</h5>  
        <p>
            With Cartwright’s arrest, peace returned to Bellmere. Lucy recovered slowly, and Holmes assured the family that the specter haunting the great bell was no ghost — only a desperate man.

            As we rode back to London, I turned to Holmes.

            "How did you know it was Cartwright?"

            Holmes smiled faintly. "A man must climb a tower to ring a severed bell. Cartwright, young and fit, was the only likely candidate. His nervousness was his undoing."

            "And Lucy?"

            "Merely a victim of fear. The human mind, Watson, can be more delicate than any rope or bell."

            I nodded, admiring once again the brilliance of my friend.

            And in the distance behind us, Bellmere Hall stood silent — the ancient bell quiet at last.
