        <h1>The Little Prince</h1>
        <h4>By Antoine de Saint-Exupéry</h4>
    
        <h5>Chapter 1: The Crash</h5>
        <p>
            The desert stretched out endlessly around me — dunes like frozen waves under the merciless sun. My plane had failed, and with it, all hopes of rescue. I had barely enough water for a week.
    
            On the second morning, as the sky blushed with dawn, I was roused not by the wind or sand, but by a voice.
    
            “Please… draw me a sheep.”
    
            I turned sharply. Standing before me was a boy — golden-haired, wide-eyed, dressed in a coat unlike any I had ever seen. He was neither afraid nor sunburnt, and there was no sign of another soul nearby.
    
            “What are you doing here?” I asked.
    
            But he only repeated his request: “Please… draw me a sheep.”
    
            Puzzled, I sketched a sheep. He rejected three attempts before finally accepting one I had drawn inside a box.
    
            “This one will do,” he smiled. “He’s sleeping inside.”
    
            And thus began my strange companionship with the little prince.
        </p>
    
        <h5>Chapter 2: The Asteroid</h5>
        <p>
            Over the days that followed, the little prince spoke little of himself, but when he did, his words were fragments — delicate, poetic.
    
            “I come from a small planet,” he said. “So small you could watch sunsets just by shifting your chair.”
    
            “And your sheep?” I asked.
    
            “He mustn’t eat my flower.”
    
            “Flower?”
    
            His eyes darkened. “She’s proud. And vain. But I love her. I left her because I didn’t understand her.”
    
            There was pain in his voice, though he tried to mask it. A flower — delicate and sharp-tongued — was waiting for him somewhere among the stars.
    
            “What planet do you come from?” I asked gently.
    
            “Asteroid B-612,” he replied, as if it were the most ordinary thing in the world.
        </p>
    
        <h5>Chapter 3: The Fox</h5>
        <p>
            One evening, as the stars blinked into existence, the prince told me of his journey.
    
            “On one world, I met a fox,” he said. “She taught me something important.”
    
            “What did she teach you?”
    
            “That what is essential is invisible to the eye.”
    
            He looked at me solemnly. “She asked to be tamed. And I did. But when I left, it hurt.”
    
            “Why leave?”
    
            “Because the flower waited.”
    
            The prince spoke of other planets too — of kings with no subjects, vain men who heard only praise, drunkards who drank to forget, and lamplighters who obeyed senseless orders. Each lonely, each absorbed in their own illusions.
    
            “Adults are strange,” he would often say.
        </p>
    
        <h5>Chapter 4: The Well in the Sand</h5>
        <p>
            On the eighth day, my water ran out.
    
            “Let’s find a well,” the prince said cheerfully.
    
            “In the desert?” I replied, but he was already walking.
    
            We journeyed far under the moonlight, and at dawn — impossibly — we found one: ancient, stone-built, with a creaking windlass.
    
            We drank in silence. Then he looked at me.
    
            “Tomorrow marks a year since I arrived here,” he said. “I must return.”
    
            I felt a sudden dread. “You can’t just leave.”
    
            “I must. My flower is waiting. And the sheep needs a muzzle.”
    
            “You’re afraid for her?”
    
            “I’m responsible for her,” he said simply.
        </p>
    
        <h5>Chapter 5: The Farewell</h5>
        <p>
            The next evening, he stood beside the wrecked plane, watching the stars.
    
            “It will look like I’m dead,” he said softly, “but it’s not true. My body is too heavy. It cannot follow.”
    
            “Don’t say that,” I whispered.
    
            “You will look up at the stars,” he smiled, “and I’ll be laughing on one of them. So whenever you see the stars, you’ll hear my laughter.”
    
            A golden snake lay coiled in the sand nearby. He stepped toward it — calm, fearless.
    
            I turned away. When I looked back, he had fallen — silently, gently — as if merely sleeping.
    
            The wind carried the silence far across the dunes.
        </p>
    
        <h5>Chapter 6: Epilogue</h5>
        <p>
            That was six years ago. I repaired my plane, returned to the world, and resumed the life of a man.
    
            But I often gaze at the stars, wondering: was that planet real? Was the flower still alive? Did the sheep eat her?
    
            And somewhere, perhaps, the little prince laughs still.
    
            “What is essential is invisible to the eye,” he had said.
    
            And I believe him.
