        <h1>The Art of War</h1>
        <h4>By Sun Tzu</h4>
    
        <h5>Chapter 1: Laying Plans</h5>
        <p>
            Every victory begins long before the battle. Understand your enemy, know yourself, assess the terrain, and calculate your strength. War is won by preparation, not brute force. Weigh advantages against costs, and never march blindly.
        </p>
    
        <h5>Chapter 2: Waging War</h5>
        <p>
            War is expensive — in resources, lives, and time. The longer it lasts, the more it drains a nation. Strike fast, strike hard. Victory without delay is mercy to both sides. But never wage war without a clear path to peace.
        </p>
    
        <h5>Chapter 3: Attack by Stratagem</h5>
        <p>
            The greatest victory is that which requires no battle. Defeating the enemy’s plans is better than defeating their army. Capture their strategy, divide their alliances, strike their minds. True power lies in subtlety.
        </p>
    
        <h5>Chapter 4: Tactical Dispositions</h5>
        <p>
            Invincibility lies in defense; victory lies in attack. Prepare for every eventuality, reveal nothing. Position yourself so that defeat is impossible — and let the enemy stumble into their own ruin.
        </p>
    
        <h5>Chapter 5: Energy</h5>
        <p>
            Use force like water: flow where resistance is weakest. Combine direct attacks with surprise to unbalance the enemy. Like drawing a bow or releasing a stone — channel energy with precision, not chaos.
        </p>
    
        <h5>Chapter 6: Weak Points and Strong</h5>
        <p>
            Every enemy has a flaw. Find the gap in their armor. Be formless, unpredictable. Show strength where you are weak, weakness where you are strong. Let the enemy chase shadows while you strike truth.
        </p>
    
        <h5>Chapter 7: Maneuvering</h5>
        <p>
            Movement is power. March only when the path is clear. Avoid entanglements and overreach. Keep morale high, avoid fatigue, and preserve unity. When you move, move like thunder. When you strike, be like lightning.
        </p>
    
        <h5>Chapter 8: Variation in Tactics</h5>
        <p>
            Adapt. There is no single path to victory. Terrain changes. Enemies shift. Your plans must bend, not break. Rigid strategy is brittle; flexible leadership is unbreakable.
        </p>
    
        <h5>Chapter 9: The Army on the March</h5>
        <p>
            Know how to read the land, the sky, and the silence. A rising cloud of dust, sudden stillness in the birds — all reveal the enemy’s position. Trust your senses, and listen for what’s not said.
        </p>
    
        <h5>Chapter 10: Terrain</h5>
        <p>
            There are six kinds of terrain, and each demands a different strategy. High ground, narrow passes, open plains — they shape both your options and the enemy’s. The wise commander shapes battle by choosing the ground.
        </p>
    
        <h5>Chapter 11: The Nine Situations</h5>
        <p>
            Armies face nine kinds of situations — from desperate escape to total advantage. Understand each one. In death ground, where retreat is impossible, men fight fiercest. Use fear wisely. Sometimes, burning bridges gives birth to courage.
        </p>
    
        <h5>Chapter 12: Attack by Fire</h5>
        <p>
            Fire is a weapon of speed and terror. Use it to cause confusion, division, and chaos — but only when the conditions are right. Know the wind. Know the dryness. Fire, like war, obeys nature, not ambition.
        </p>
    
        <h5>Chapter 13: Use of Spies</h5>
        <p>
            All warfare is based on deception. To deceive, you must first know. Use spies — local, internal, double, doomed, and surviving. The best victories are shaped in the shadows. Information wins wars before they start.
