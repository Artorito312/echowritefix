        <h1>Shutter Island</h1>
        <h4>By Dennis Lehane</h4>
    
        <h5>Prologue: Arrival</h5>
        <p>
            The sea was restless as the ferry cut through the gray Atlantic. U.S. Marshal Teddy Daniels leaned against the railing, his jaw set against the salt spray. Behind him, his new partner, Chuck Aule, offered a cigarette and a question: “You ever been to a place like this before?”
    
            Ahead lay Shutter Island — remote, forbidding, home to Ashecliffe Hospital for the criminally insane.
    
            A patient had escaped: Rachel Solando, a woman convicted of drowning her three children.
    
            The island loomed larger. And something about it — the walls, the silence, the sense of being watched — made Teddy's stomach churn.
        </p>
    
        <h5>Chapter 1: The Disappearance</h5>
        <p>
            Rachel Solando vanished from a locked cell. No broken windows. No signs of struggle. No witnesses. Just a cryptic note hidden beneath a floorboard: *“The law of 4. Who is 67?”*
    
            The doctors were tight-lipped. Dr. Cawley, the head psychiatrist, smiled too easily. “We don’t use shackles here,” he said. “We believe in trust.”
    
            But trust was in short supply.
    
            Teddy paced the halls of Ward A, stared into the hollow eyes of the patients. Something was wrong here — not just with the disappearance, but with the island itself.
    
            Every door had a lock. Every conversation felt rehearsed. And the storm was coming.
        </p>
    
        <h5>Chapter 2: The Storm</h5>
        <p>
            The hurricane arrived like a siege, battering the cliffs and tearing up the trees. The island was sealed — no phones, no ferry, no way out.
    
            Teddy’s migraines worsened. Visions of his wife Dolores — lost in a fire two years ago — flickered at the edges of his thoughts.
    
            “You have to get off this island,” she whispered in his dreams. “They’re not who they say they are.”
    
            Chuck and Teddy stumbled through sodden grounds, interrogating orderlies and scribbling names. They searched caves and hospitals, chasing phantoms.
    
            But the storm wasn’t just outside. It had entered his mind.
        </p>
    
        <h5>Chapter 3: The Truth Beneath</h5>
        <p>
            Ward C — the restricted wing. A place for the violent, the broken, the irredeemable.
    
            There, behind thick bars and eyes that flickered with madness, a man called George Noyce whispered things he shouldn’t have known.
    
            “They brought you here,” he hissed. “You think you’re investigating? No, Marshal. You’re the rat in the maze.”
    
            Teddy’s world tilted. He stumbled from cell to cell, memory and reality blurring. He saw fires that had never burned. He heard voices that weren’t there.
    
            The truth was fracturing, piece by piece.
        </p>
    
        <h5>Chapter 4: The Lighthouse</h5>
        <p>
            The lighthouse stood like a sentinel, unreachable by storm-tossed cliffs and locked gates. Teddy was certain — they were doing something inside. Experiments. Brain surgeries. Hidden files. The truth.
    
            Chuck vanished. No warning. No struggle. Just… gone.
    
            Alone, frantic, Teddy descended the lighthouse stairs, each step echoing with dread. At the bottom, Dr. Cawley waited.
    
            “Welcome, Andrew,” he said.
    
            That name. Andrew.
    
            The floor dropped from beneath him.
        </p>
    
        <h5>Chapter 5: Remembering</h5>
        <p>
            The files were laid bare. The photographs. The reports. The death certificate.
    
            Dolores had drowned their children. Andrew Laeddis — Teddy — had killed her in a fit of grief and guilt.
    
            Ashecliffe had been his prison and his refuge. His identity as “Teddy Daniels” was a role — a last-ditch experiment to reach him. The note? A puzzle he’d written himself. Rachel Solando was an invention. Chuck was Dr. Sheehan, his real doctor.
    
            “We let you play it out,” Dr. Cawley said. “To see if you’d choose to live as a man or die as a myth.”
    
            And for a moment — just a moment — Andrew remembered.
    
            He screamed. He wept. And then he was quiet.
        </p>
    
        <h5>Epilogue: The Question</h5>
        <p>
            Days passed.
    
            On the hospital steps, Andrew sat beside Dr. Sheehan, calm, distant.
    
            “So, Marshal,” he said, “where do we go from here?”
    
            The question lingered. Did he remember and pretend not to? Or had he truly fallen again into the delusion?
    
            “Which would be worse,” he asked, eyes distant, “to live as a monster or to die as a good man?”
    
            The answer was silence.
    
            And the orderlies approached, needle in hand.
