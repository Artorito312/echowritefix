        <h1>Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone</h1>
        <h4>By J.K. Rowling</h4>
        <h5>Chapter 1: The Boy Who Lived</h5>
        <p>In the quiet town of Little Whinging, the Dursley family lived a perfectly normal life. They were a proud, ordinary family who detested anything that was out of the ordinary or peculiar. They avoided all things magical, and particularly, anything involving their nephew, Harry Potter. Harry’s parents, James and Lily Potter, had died in a mysterious attack years before, leaving the boy in the care of the Dursleys. But Harry was no ordinary child, and his story began the night he was left on their doorstep. That night, three figures—Albus Dumbledore, Professor McGonagall, and Hagrid—came together at Number 4 Privet Drive. The three wizards, with their cloaks and wands, left baby Harry with a note explaining his lineage, and his extraordinary survival. Harry's lightning-bolt-shaped scar on his forehead was a constant reminder of the evil wizard, Voldemort, who had tried and failed to kill him. The Dursleys had no intention of ever acknowledging the magical world, though. They didn’t care about magic or the significance of the boy in their care. To them, Harry would be nothing more than a nuisance.</p>
    
        <h5>Chapter 2: The Vanishing Glass</h5>
        <p>As Harry grew older, life at the Dursleys became increasingly difficult. Harry was forced to live in a cupboard under the stairs, a tiny space barely big enough to hold his belongings. The Dursleys treated him with disdain, while their spoiled son Dudley was indulged at every turn. Harry was forced to endure cruel taunts and neglect, and the boy grew up under the constant shadow of his cousin’s bullying. Despite the unkind treatment, Harry was a quiet, kind-hearted child. However, there were moments that would hint at something more within him. Strange things started to happen around him: once, his hair grew back overnight after a particularly harsh haircut, and another time, he found himself on the school roof without knowing how he had gotten there. On Dudley’s birthday, Harry’s strange powers became more apparent. During a trip to the zoo, Harry unknowingly spoke to a snake, and the glass of its enclosure vanished, allowing the snake to escape. The Dursleys were furious, and Harry was left to wonder about these strange occurrences. Could there be something more to him than they had ever realized?</p>
    
        <h5>Chapter 3: The Letters From No One</h5>
        <p>The quiet, isolated life of the Dursleys was soon disrupted when Harry received his first letter. The letter was addressed to Harry Potter, in the cupboard under the stairs, and it was the beginning of a series of increasingly strange and persistent letters that followed. Uncle Vernon, afraid of what the letters meant, confiscated them before Harry could open them, but the letters didn’t stop. Soon, the letters were coming from every possible location—through the door, under the floorboards, and even through the chimney. As the letters grew in number and creativity, the Dursleys became desperate to stop them from reaching Harry. They went to extreme lengths, even retreating to a shack on an isolated island to escape. But on Harry’s eleventh birthday, as the clock struck midnight, a giant thundering knock was heard on the door. In walked Rubeus Hagrid, a giant of a man with wild hair and a booming voice, carrying a birthday cake and a letter. The letter was Harry’s invitation to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and Harry’s life was about to change forever.</p>
    
        <h5>Chapter 4: The Keeper of the Keys</h5>
        <p>Hagrid was furious when he learned what the Dursleys had done to Harry. Harry had been kept in the dark about his magical heritage for far too long. The giant man, a Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts, had come to deliver the news: Harry was a wizard, and he was to attend the magical school of Hogwarts. Hagrid was surprised to learn that Harry had been kept in the dark about everything, including the circumstances of his parents' death. It was explained that Harry’s parents had been murdered by the dark wizard Voldemort, and Harry, miraculously, had survived an attack that left him with a lightning-bolt-shaped scar on his forehead. Harry’s survival had made him famous in the wizarding world, but all of that had been hidden from him by the Dursleys. They had treated him cruelly and had refused to acknowledge his true identity. Hagrid, full of excitement and energy, took Harry shopping for his school supplies in Diagon Alley. There, Harry learned about the wizarding world for the first time, and for the first time, he felt like he belonged somewhere. Harry was given everything he needed for Hogwarts—robes, a wand, and even a pet owl named Hedwig. For Harry, this was the beginning of a new life, one full of mystery, magic, and incredible possibilities.</p>
    
        <h5>Chapter 5: Diagon Alley</h5>
        <p>The next day, Hagrid took Harry to Diagon Alley, a magical shopping district hidden from the eyes of Muggles. Harry marveled at the incredible sights that surrounded him, including the wizarding shops filled with magical items. He was shown a variety of magical instruments, such as cauldrons and potions, and introduced to the art of wand-making. In the wand shop, Harry learned that he needed a wand of his own, and Ollivanders, the most famous wandmaker, explained the intricacies of wand selection. To Harry’s surprise, he was chosen by a wand made of holly and phoenix feather, the very wand that had once belonged to Voldemort. It was a moment that would be significant later in Harry’s journey. Harry was also introduced to Gringotts, the wizarding bank, where he learned that he had a small fortune waiting for him, which his parents had left behind. But amidst the excitement of the magical world, Harry was reminded that he was a famous figure, and there was a dark past that had followed him. As he left Diagon Alley, Harry couldn’t help but feel both excited and apprehensive. He was entering a world of wonder, but he had no idea of the dangers that awaited him.</p>
    
        <h5>Chapter 6: The Journey to Hogwarts</h5>
        <p>Harry’s journey to Hogwarts began on the Hogwarts Express, a magical train that would take him to the school. On the train, he met several new friends, including Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, who would later become his closest companions. Harry learned that Ron came from a large wizarding family, and Hermione was an extremely intelligent and well-read student who had already mastered several magical spells. They chatted about their hopes for the coming school year and exchanged their excitement about learning magic. But the journey was not without its dangers. Harry and his friends encountered Draco Malfoy, a spoiled and arrogant boy who immediately took a disliking to Harry. Malfoy tried to befriend Harry, but Harry saw through his false charm and rejected him. Upon arriving at Hogwarts, Harry’s sense of awe and wonder deepened. The school was magnificent, with towering spires and a majestic castle surrounded by dark forests and glimmering lakes. The first sight of the castle was a moment Harry would never forget.</p>
    
        <h5>Chapter 7: The Sorting Hat</h5>
        <p>Upon arriving at Hogwarts, all the first-year students were led to the Great Hall, where the Sorting Hat ceremony awaited them. The Sorting Hat was a magical hat that would determine which of the four Hogwarts houses—Gryffindor, Slytherin, Ravenclaw, or Hufflepuff—each student would belong to. Harry nervously awaited his turn. When it came time for him to put on the Sorting Hat, the hat spoke to him in a voice only he could hear. It offered to place him in Slytherin, but Harry’s strong desire to be with people who were brave and loyal led the Sorting Hat to choose Gryffindor. Harry was filled with relief as he joined his new friends at the Gryffindor table. From that moment, he knew he was where he belonged.</p>
    
        <h5>Chapter 8: The Potion Master</h5>
        <p>As Harry settled into life at Hogwarts, he quickly learned that being a student in a magical school was no easy task. Some classes were more difficult than others, and one professor who stood out was Severus Snape, the Potions Master. Snape had a dark and intimidating presence, and he seemed to take a special dislike to Harry. Snape’s cold demeanor and harsh grading made him a source of constant frustration for Harry, and he couldn’t shake the feeling that Snape had something against him. Harry’s suspicions grew when he discovered that Snape had been a former member of Slytherin and had a history with Harry’s parents. There was something more sinister about Snape that Harry couldn’t yet understand.</p>
