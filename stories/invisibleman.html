        <h1>The Invisible Man</h1>
        <h4>By Ralph Ellison</h4>
        <h5>Chapter 1: A Stranger in Iping</h5>
        <p>
            It was a biting February afternoon when a peculiar visitor arrived at the Coach and Horses Inn in the quiet village of Iping. He was swathed in bandages from head to toe, dark goggles masking his eyes, and a wide-brimmed hat pulled low. His voice, when he spoke, was muffled and abrupt.
    
            "A room. Immediately," he demanded of Mrs. Hall, the innkeeper. "And privacy, above all."
    
            Mrs. Hall, ever eager for business during the dull season, obliged him. She watched curiously as the man lugged in several crates marked with odd symbols and scientific notations.
    
            "A scholar, perhaps?" she ventured.
    
            "Never mind what I am," he snapped, vanishing into the upstairs room.
    
            The villagers whispered. Some said he was a burn victim. Others, a fugitive. But no one could deny the chill that followed him — or the strange noises late at night from his room.
        </p>
    
        <h5>Chapter 2: Curious Events</h5>
        <p>
            Within days, the stranger had become the talk of the village. He rarely emerged, save for meals and supplies, and always kept himself shrouded. Yet oddities began to occur.
    
            Mrs. Hall found her parlor ransacked — though no one had entered. Furniture moved of its own accord. Footprints appeared in fresh snow with no body to make them.
    
            "Ghosts," muttered old Mr. Cuss.
    
            But the stranger dismissed it all. "Superstition. Accidents."
    
            Then, one evening, a bottle lifted from the shelf and flew across the bar, smashing into the wall.
    
            "Enough!" Mrs. Hall stormed upstairs to confront the man.
    
            What she saw froze her to the marrow. His bandaged head was gone. His face... wasn’t there. Just a gaping void beneath the goggles.
    
            She screamed. And the door slammed shut by an unseen force.
        </p>
    
        <h5>Chapter 3: The Truth Revealed</h5>
        <p>
            The stranger could hide no longer.
    
            "I am Griffin," he announced the next day, surrounded by frightened townsfolk. "A scientist. A pioneer."
    
            He revealed his secret — a formula that could bend light around the human body. Invisibility.
    
            "I gave up everything for this discovery," he growled. "My home, my name... my flesh."
    
            But it had gone wrong. The process was irreversible. He could not restore himself. And now, hunted, scorned, he had come to Iping to continue his work in peace.
    
            The villagers were unconvinced. Mr. Bunting, the vicar, accused him of theft. Others demanded he leave.
    
            Griffin's eyes — invisible though they were — seemed to burn.
    
            "You dare defy me? Then fear me."
        </p>
    
        <h5>Chapter 4: Terror Unleashed</h5>
        <p>
            That night, the village descended into chaos.
    
            Windows shattered. Doors slammed. People were struck down by unseen hands. The invisible man stalked the streets, a ghost of vengeance.
    
            Mr. Cuss was found unconscious, bruised and shaken. The constable was stripped of his truncheon and knocked out cold.
    
            Griffin roared with laughter as he walked openly, unseen. "Now they believe!"
    
            Panic spread. Families locked their doors. Rumors of a monster spread to neighboring towns. The search for Griffin began.
    
            But how do you hunt what you cannot see?
        </p>
    
        <h5>Chapter 5: The Chase</h5>
        <p>
            A former colleague, Dr. Kemp, residing in nearby Port Burdock, received an unexpected visitor one evening — doors opening on their own, food vanishing from plates.
    
            Then Griffin revealed himself once more.
    
            "Kemp," he said, "you will help me. Together we shall build an empire of fear. I shall be Invisible King — and you, my vizier."
    
            Kemp recoiled. "You're mad."
    
            Griffin’s voice grew cold. "Then you're my enemy."
    
            Kemp wasted no time. As Griffin slept, he sent a message to the authorities.
    
            When Griffin awoke to sirens and shouting, his fury was boundless. He fled into the night, pursued by soldiers, dogs, and villagers armed with nets and rifles.
        </p>
    
        <h5>Chapter 6: The End of the Invisible Man</h5>
        <p>
            Griffin’s rampage ended in a quiet alley.
    
            Cornered, exhausted, bleeding from unseen wounds, he was caught by a crowd of men who struck at shadows and followed bloodstains.
    
            "Hold him!" Kemp shouted. "He’s weakening!"
    
            Bit by bit, Griffin reappeared — his face, his hands, his twisted, brilliant, broken body.
    
            He died whispering, "I only wanted to be great."
    
            The crowd fell silent.
    
            Days later, his notebooks were found — pages filled with brilliant theory, madness, and regret.
    
            Kemp burned them all.
    
            "The world," he said, "is not ready for an invisible man."
